Command++ is an interactive shell written in Rust that provides a user-friendly command-line interface for executing commands on various platforms, including Windows and Unix-based systems. This shell supports basic commands like "ls" (list files), "cd" (change directory), and allows you to execute any system command available in your system's PATH environment variable. It provides real-time feedback on command execution, displaying both the command's output and any error messages produced.
